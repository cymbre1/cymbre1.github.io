      <p class="content"><b>6</b> For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government
will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. <b>7</b> Of the increase of his government and
peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his
kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that
time on and forever. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.</p>

you as we celebrate the birth of Jesus this holiday season.  I would like to
wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p>
